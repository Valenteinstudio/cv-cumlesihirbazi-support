<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19.02.2026</p>

<p>CV Cümle Sihirbazı respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use the app, why it is processed, and how it is protected.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>CV Cümle Sihirbazı does not require an account and does not ask for personal details such as name, email address, phone number, or contact information.</p>

<h2>2. User Input (Text You Enter)</h2>
<p>When you enter text (for example, a CV sentence), the app processes that text to generate improved versions.</p>
<p class="muted"><strong>What is processed:</strong> the text you type into the app.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party AI Processing</h2>
<p>To generate results, the text you provide is securely transmitted to a third-party AI service provider for processing.</p>
<p>The text is used only to produce the requested output and is not used by the app for advertising, profiling, or tracking.</p>
<p class="muted"><strong>Important:</strong> The app does not request or require you to include sensitive personal information in your text. Please avoid entering personal identifiers (e.g., ID numbers) in your CV sentence.</p>

<h2>4. Permission / Consent</h2>
<p>Before any text is sent to the third-party AI service provider, the app asks for your permission (one-time consent).</p>
<p>If you do not give permission, the “Profesyonelleştir” feature will not send your text and will not work.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>The app does not permanently store or log the text you enter. The text is processed to generate a response and is not saved in the app as a history.</p>

<h2>6. Local Storage (On-Device Only)</h2>
<p>The app stores limited technical information locally on your device to function properly, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily usage limits / remaining credits</li>
  <li>Premium status (to unlock unlimited usage)</li>
  <li>A random device identifier (generated on-device) to support usage limits</li>
  <li>Whether you have seen the in-app guide</li>
  <li>Your consent choice (to remember your permission)</li>
</ul>
<p>This information stays on your device and is not used to identify you.</p>

<h2>7. Payments</h2>
<p>In-app purchases are processed securely by Apple’s in-app purchase system. The app does not receive or store your payment card details.</p>

<h2>8. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
<p>CV Cümle Sihirbazı does not use advertising networks and does not perform cross-app tracking.</p>

<h2>9. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The app does not sell your personal data.</p>
<p>The app shares your text input only when necessary to provide the core feature: generating improved CV sentences via a third-party AI service provider (after you give consent).</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
