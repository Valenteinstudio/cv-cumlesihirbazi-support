<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19.02.2026</p>

<p>CV Cümle Sihirbazı respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use the app, how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>

<h2>1. Account & Personal Information</h2>
<p>The app does not require account creation and does not request personal details such as name, email address, phone number, or contact information.</p>

<h2>2. User-Entered Text</h2>
<p>When you type a CV sentence into the app, that text is processed to generate improved versions.</p>
<p class="muted"><strong>Data processed:</strong> Only the text voluntarily entered by you in the app.</p>

<h2>3. AI Processing (Third-Party Service)</h2>

<p>To provide its core functionality, the app securely transmits the text you enter to OpenAI, L.L.C., an external AI processing service provider.</p>

<p>The transmitted data includes only the text you voluntarily enter in the app. No name, email address, payment information, contact details, or direct personal identifiers are transmitted for AI processing.</p>

<p>The transmitted text is used solely to generate the requested CV suggestions. It is not used by this app for advertising, profiling, marketing, or tracking purposes.</p>

<h2>4. User Permission (Consent)</h2>
<p>Before any text is transmitted to the external AI processing service provider, the app displays a one-time consent screen explaining this data transmission.</p>

<p>If you do not provide consent, your text will not be transmitted and the “Profesyonelleştir” feature will not function.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>The app does not permanently store, log, or maintain a history of the text you enter. Text is processed temporarily to generate a response and is not saved within the app.</p>

<h2>6. On-Device Storage</h2>
<p>The app stores limited technical data locally on your device to ensure proper functionality, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Daily usage limits / remaining credits</li>
  <li>Premium purchase status</li>
  <li>A randomly generated device identifier (created on-device) to support usage limits</li>
  <li>Your consent preference</li>
  <li>Whether you have viewed the in-app guide</li>
</ul>

<p>This information remains stored only on your device and is not used to directly identify you.</p>

<h2>7. Payments</h2>
<p>In-app purchases are processed securely through Apple’s in-app purchase system. The app does not receive, process, or store payment card information.</p>

<h2>8. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
<p>The app does not use third-party analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or cross-app tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>9. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The app does not sell or trade personal data.</p>

<p>The only data sharing that occurs is the transmission of user-entered text to the external AI processing service provider, strictly for the purpose of generating improved CV suggestions, and only after user consent.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
